- SQLITE --> fast, light
- model table User:
-- id, name, surname, preferences, restrictions, health_condition, caretaker,...
- pydantic dataclass or @dataclass -- one of these.
- code: create database file, create table using that model User

if __name__ == __main__:
1) function to create database with table
2) connect to this database
3) retrieve or write data to databasse

- look at how in python connect to sqlite database?
- look at how in python retrieve the data from database?
