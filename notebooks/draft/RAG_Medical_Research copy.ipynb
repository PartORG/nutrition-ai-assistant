Spatacsin, the protein encoded by the SPG11 gene, plays a critical role in autophagy and lysosomal homeostasis, which are essential for neuronal health. Its impairment leads to defective cellular clearance and neurodegeneration. Recently, personalized and precision nutrition have emerged as promising approaches to enhance clinical outcomes by tailoring dietary interventions to individual genetic, metabolic, and phenotypic profiles. Objectives: This mini scoping review aimed to synthesize current evidence on the application of personalized and precision nutrition in SPG11 and to explore how insights from related neurodegenerative diseases could inform the development of future dietary and metabolic interventions for this rare disorder. Methods: Following PRISMA-ScR guidelines, a scoping review was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases (2020–2024). Eligible studies included investigations addressing nutritional, genomic, or metabolic interventions in neurodegenerative diseases. Of 30 screened papers, nine met the inclusion criteria, primarily focusing on nutritional and metabolic interventions related to neurodegenerative and neuromuscular conditions. Results: To date, no dietary intervention trials have been conducted specifically for SPG11. However, evidence from studies on related neurodegenerative diseases suggests that antioxidant, mitochondrial-supportive, and microbiota-targeted dietary approaches may beneficially influence key pathological processes such as oxidative stress, lipid dysregulation, and autophagy—core mechanisms that are also central to SPG11 pathophysiology. Conclusions: Although current evidence remains preliminary, personalized nutrition is a promising supplementary strategy for managing neurodegenerative diseases, including SPG11. Future research should incorporate systems-based approaches that combine dietary, metabolic, and neuroimaging assessments, with sex and comorbidity-stratified analyses, multi-omics profiling, and predictive modeling. These frameworks could help design safe, effective, and personalized nutritional interventions aimed at enhancing metabolic resilience and slowing disease progression in SPG11.406pt', 'ptex.fullbanner': 'This is pdfTeX, Version 3.141592653-2.6-1.40.25 (TeX Live 2023) kpathsea version 6.3.5', 'author': 'Paulo Renato Ribeiro, Carmen Ferreira, Carlos Antunes, Gonçalo Dias, Maria João Lima, Raquel Guiné and Edite Teixeira-Lemos', 'title': 'Nutritional Approaches in Neurodegenerative Disorders: A Mini Scoping Review with Emphasis on SPG11-Related Conditions', 'source': '..\\\\documents\\\\DataBase\\\\Nutritional_Approaches_in_Neurodegenerative_Disord.pdf', 'total_pages': 14, 'page': 2, 'page_label': '3', 'id': 'chunk_4427'}, page_content='disorders.

Educommunication is a methodology that utilizes communication as a pedagogical tool, with the potential to positively enhance the teaching–learning process. This study aims to identify and map educommunication strategies designed to educate caregivers and patients with neurodegenerative diseases about food and nutrition. Methods: This scoping review followed the JBI Institute Reviewer’s Manual. The search was conducted between June 2022 and March 2023 in databases including PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science. Results: Out of 189 studies identified, 29 met the eligibility criteria, and only 3 were suitable for inclusion in this review. Conclusion: Studies using educommunication for food and nutrition education are scarce.

      "🤖 RAG Answer: Based on the provided context, I can offer some general nutritional advice for people with ALS. However, please note that this is not a substitute for personalized medical advice. It's essential to consult a healthcare professional or a registered dietitian for specific guidance.\n",
      "\n",
      "From the context, we know that a diet rich in fruits and vegetables can confer protection against the development of ALS. Here are some general nutritional tips:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Eat a balanced diet**: Focus on whole, unprocessed foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats.\n",
      "2. **Increase antioxidant intake**: Antioxidants, such as vitamins C and E, can help protect against oxidative stress, which may contribute to ALS progression. Include antioxidant-rich foods like berries, leafy greens, and nuts in your diet.\n",
      "3. **Stay hydrated**: Adequate hydration is essential for overall health, and it may help alleviate symptoms like muscle cramps and spasms.\n",
      "4. **Consider a Mediterranean-style diet**: This diet, rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats, has been associated with a lower risk of neurodegenerative diseases.\n",
      "5. **Maintain a healthy weight**: Being underweight or overweight can exacerbate ALS symptoms. Work with a healthcare professional or registered dietitian to achieve a healthy weight.\n",
      "6. **Choose nutrient-dense foods**: Focus on foods that provide a high amount of nutrients per calorie, such as lean proteins, whole grains, and a variety of fruits and vegetables.\n",
      "7. **Consider supplements**: Certain supplements, like vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids, may be beneficial for people with ALS. However, always consult with a healthcare professional before adding any supplements to your diet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember, a well-balanced diet can help mitigate the progression of ALS, but it's essential to work with a healthcare professional to develop a personalized nutrition plan.\n",

      "🤖 RAG Answer: Based on the provided context, it seems that a ketogenic diet may be beneficial for people with migraines, particularly those with drug-resistant migraines. Here are some diet-related suggestions:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Consider a ketogenic diet**: The context suggests that a ketogenic diet may be effective in reducing the frequency and severity of migraines. A ketogenic diet is high in fat, moderate in protein, and low in carbohydrates.\n",
      "2. **Low-carbohydrate diet may not be as effective**: The context mentions that a low-carbohydrate diet did not show significant changes in migraine symptoms, suggesting that a ketogenic diet may be more beneficial.\n",
      "3. **Individual results may vary**: While the context suggests promising results, it's essential to note that individual results may vary. Some people may not respond to a ketogenic diet, and other factors, such as lifestyle and genetics, may influence the effectiveness of this diet.\n",
      "4. **Consult a healthcare professional**: Before making any significant changes to your diet, it's crucial to consult with a healthcare professional, especially if you have a history of migraines or other health conditions.\n",
      "5. **Keep a food diary**: Keeping a food diary can help you identify potential triggers and patterns in your migraine symptoms, which can inform your dietary choices.\n",
      "\n",
      "Remember that everyone's experience with migraines is unique, and what works for one person may not work for another. It's essential to work with a healthcare professional to develop a personalized plan that takes into account your specific needs and health status.\n",
      "\n",
      "🤖 RAG Answer: Unfortunately, the provided context does not explicitly mention who should consider a keto diet. However, based on general knowledge about the ketogenic diet, it is often recommended for individuals with certain health conditions, such as:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Epilepsy: The ketogenic diet has been shown to be effective in reducing seizures in people with epilepsy.\n",
      "2. Type 2 diabetes: The diet may help improve blood sugar control and reduce the need for medication.\n",
      "3. Alzheimer's disease: Some research suggests that the ketogenic diet may help slow the progression of Alzheimer's disease.\n",
      "4. Obesity: The diet may help with weight loss and improve body composition.\n",
      "5. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS): The diet may help improve insulin sensitivity and reduce androgen levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's essential to consult with a healthcare professional before starting a ketogenic diet, especially if you have any underlying health conditions or are taking medications.\n",
      "\n",
