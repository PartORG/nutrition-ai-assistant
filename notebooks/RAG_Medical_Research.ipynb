      "Introduction\n",
      "Parkinson’s disease (PD) is classically diagnosed by move -\n",
      "ment disorders, including bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor, and \n",
      "postural instability. 1 Eventually, motor symptoms such as \n",
      "tremors, rigidity, slow movement, depression, and demen -\n",
      "tia become evident. 2 Biochemically, these symptoms result \n",
      "from dopamine (DA) depletion in the projections from the \n",
      "substantia nigra pars compacta to the striatum,3,4 particularly \n",
      "in the nigrostriatal pathways. This depletion is probably due \n",
      "to aging, brain injury, toxicity, or other factors; hence, PD is \n",
      "still considered an idiopathic disorder. Several mechanisms \n",
      "have been implicated in PD pathogenesis, with α-synuclein \n",
      "aggregation being central to disease development. In famil -\n",
      "ial cases of PD, many genes are involved, especially as ab-\n",
      "normal intra-neuronal aggregates of α-synuclein, also called \n",
      "Lewy bodies, are found in the PD brain. 5,6 Multiple other \n",
      "processes are thought to contribute, with several studies \n",
      "suggesting that abnormal protein clearance, mitochondrial \n",
      "dysfunction, and neuroinflammation play roles in PD onset \n",
      "and progression. However, the relationships between these \n",
      "pathways remain unclear. 7 In brief, genetic susceptibility \n",
      "and environmental factors, 7 which may cause endoplasmic \n",
      "reticulum stress, 8 mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, \n",
      "and disruption of the autophagy system, 9 contribute to PD \n",
      "development.\n",
      "Currently, there is no cure for PD. Levodopa was intro -\n",
      "duced in the 1960s to replenish DA loss, but it serves only \n",
      "as a palliative treatment. Furthermore, chronic use of levo -\n",
      "dopa may result in significant adverse effects such as ni -\n",
      "grostriatal degeneration and dyskinesia.10 Other therapeutic \n",
      "approaches—including cell therapy, gene therapy, and deep \n",
      "brain stimulation—are still in the trial stages.\n",
      "In this context, nutritional management offers a promising \n",
      "option to help control disease symptoms, as foods contain \n",
      "antioxidants, trace metals, and energy that may help coun -\n",
      "teract cognitive decline and muscle weakness. Epidemio -\n",
      "logical and biochemical studies suggest that the right choice \n",
      "of foods can help manage PD symptoms. 11–20 Recent stud-\n",
      "ies have revealed that certain nutrients may reduce the risk \n",
      "of PD, while others may contribute to neurodegeneration or \n",
      "Abstract\n",
      "Parkinson’s disease (PD) is described as an age-related neurodegenerative disease primarily caused by the loss of \n",
      "dopamine, a neurotransmitter, in the substantia nigra pars compacta. In this disease, tremor, movement disorders, and \n",
      "postural instability are generally observed, and depression gradually develops. However, various non-motor symptoms \n",
      "such as mood changes, depression, cognitive impairment, anxiety, constipation, and others are often observed before the \n",
      "PD diagnosis and worsen as the disease progresses. Generally, this disease is still considered idiopathic, with multiple \n",
      "possible causes including pesticides and brain injury. In familial cases of PD, however, a set of genes have been identified \n",
      "as causes of PD, including the α- synuclein gene, Parkin, PTEN-induced kinase 1, and Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 . To \n",
      "date, there is no cure for this disease, except for some palliative treatments such as dopa/dopamine therapy. Dopamine \n",
      "administration from external sources is effective only for a couple of years; after that, dyskinesia and other neurological \n",
      "complications develop. Scientists are researching gene and cell therapies, but effective solutions have yet to be found. \n",
      "Since environmental factors are involved in the majority of PD cases, it is important to understand the role nutrition plays \n",
      "in both neuroprotection and neurodegeneration. In this context, managing PD through nutrition, for example, by choosing \n",
      "the right foods to consume or avoid, may benefit Parkinson’s patients. In short, the Mediterranean diet combined with the \n",
      "Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet, known together as the Mediterranean-Dietary Approaches to Stop Hyper-\n",
      "tension Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay diet, has been found effective in maintaining better cognitive function \n",
